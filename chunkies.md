Notes:

We redesigned a chunkie. We call PolkaChunkie.
We managed to deploy the Chunkies on a polkanode thruh the scripts.
We encountered the Problem with creating the .json dump after the deployment.
We managed to create a UI Designer which changes a color of ipfs loaded SVG for reminting.
We concepted a Concept Minter.
For the slides we use Midjourney.
