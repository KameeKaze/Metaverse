# CCTF Challenge for Polkadot Metaverse Championship

## Description
CCTF is a Capture the Flag (CTF) game. CTF in computer security is an exercise in which 'flags' are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. Competitors steal flags either from other competitors (attack/defense-style CTFs) or from the organizers (jeopardy-style challenges).

From CCTF volume 9, we have started to use a decentralized system: Solidity smart contract deployed and players send signed messages. Flags became private keys. We replaced CTFd to our smart contract, but it needs improvements. 

## Task

Improve the CCTF smart contract. You can improve the flag submission (eg. fix the hidden vuln from the last game), add features or create a frontend. Be creative, make something useful.
