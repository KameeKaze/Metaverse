# Privacy 

## Data in the HTTP/API requests
## Use https instead of http
HTTPS uses the SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt communications so that attackers can't steal data.
It ensures that any data transferred remains unknown to read for unwanted participants.

Uses encryption to keep data secure.

## Data in the WSS channels

- Enable CORS. WebSocket doesn't come with CORS inbuilt
- Implement rate limiting.
- Restrict payload size
- Use SSL over websockets

## Network data

## Think about timing and even if you have multiple addresses, balance checks can give a good base for statistics on which addresses belong to the same wallet/browser

Several methods have been proposed to improve the privacy of blockchains (mixers, zero knowledge, etc.). At the moment, the solutions relying on zero-knowledge proof of knowledge are the ones providing the strongest privacy features -> using Zcash z-address to send private transaction


## Consider what would happen if you use the service through proxy/TOR/etc

- Securely store identity keys
- Strong cryptographic algorithm
